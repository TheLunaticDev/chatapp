    <h2 class="text-xl font-medium">WELCOME TO ONLYMARRIAGE</h2><br />
    <p>
        We (OnlyMarriage, Inc.) hope you find it useful. By
        accessing or otherwise iteracting with our servers, services, websites, mobile app ("App"),
        or any associated content/postings (together, "ONLYMARRIAGE"), you agree to these
        Terms of Use ("TOU") (last updated September 01, 2024). You acknowledge and agree
        ONLYMARRIAGE is a private site owned and operated by OnlyMarriage, Inc. If you are
        accessing or using ONLYMARRIAGE on behalf of a business, you represent and warrant to
        ONLYMARRIAGE that you have authority to accept the TOU on behalf of that business and
        that that business agrees to the TOU. If you do not agree to the TOU, you are not
        authorized to use ONLYMARRIAGE or download the App. We may modify the TOU at any
        time in our sole discretion. You are responsible for periodically checking for changes and
        are bound by them if you continue to use ONLYMARRIAGE. All our other policies, site
        rules, and agreements referenced below or on ONLYMARRIAGE, are fully incorporated
        into this TOU, and you agree to them as well.
    </p><br />
    <h2 class="text-xl font-medium inline">LICENSE:</h2>

        If you agree to the TOU and (1) are of sufficient age and capacity to use
        ONLYMARRIAGE and be bound by the TOU, or (2) use ONLYMARRIAGE on behalf of a
        business, thereby binding that business to the TOU, we grant you a limited, revocable,
        non-exclusive, non-assignable license to use ONLYMARRIAGE in compliance with the TOU;
        unlicensed use is unauthorized. You agree not to display, "frame," make derivative works,

        verifying, or terminating your access/license/account. You agree (1) not to bypass said
        moderation, (2) we are not liable for moderating or not moderating, and (3) nothing we
        say or do waives our right to moderate, or not. Unless licensed by us in a separate written
        or electronic agreement, you agree not to (i) rent, lease, sell, publish, distribute, license,
        sublicense, assign, transfer, or otherwise make available ONLYMARRIAGE or our
        application programming interface ("API"), (ii) copy, adapt, create derivative works of,
        decompile, reverse engineer, translate, localize, port or modify the App, the API, any
        website code, or any software used to provide ONLYMARRIAGE, (iii) combine or integrate
        ONLYMARRIAGE or the API with any software, technology, services, or materials not
        authorized by us, (iv) circumvent any functionality that controls access to or otherwise
        protects ONLYMARRIAGE or the API, or (v) remove or alter any copyright, trademark or
        other proprietary rights notices. You agree not to use ONLYMARRIAGE or the API in any
        manner or for any purpose that infringes, misappropriates, or otherwise violates any
        intellectual property right or other right of any person, or that violates any applicable law.
    </p><br /><br />
    <h2 class="text-xl font-medium inline">SAFETY:</h2>

    </p><br /><br />
    <h2 class="text-xl font-medium inline">LIQUIDATED DAMAGES:</h2>
    <p class="inline">
        You further agree that if you violate the TOU, or you encourage,
        support, benefit from, or induce others to do so, you will be jointly and severally liable to
        us for liquidated damages as follows for: (A) collecting/harvesting ONLYMARRIAGE users'
        information, including personal or identifying information - $1 per violation; (B)

        your use of ONLYMARRIAGE without that party's express written consent - $1,000 per
        violation; (C) misrepresenting your identity or affiliation to anyone in connection with your
        use of ONLYMARRIAGE - $1,000 per violation; (D) posting or attempting to post Prohibited
        Content - $4 per violation; (E) posting or attempting to post Prohibited Content in any paid

        obtained from ONLYMARRIAGE - $25 per violation; (G) using ONLYMARRIAGE user
        information to make/send an unauthorized/unsolicited text message, call, or
        communication to a ONLYMARRIAGE user - $500 per text/call/communication; (H) creating
        a misleading or unlawful ONLYMARRIAGE account or buying/selling a ONLYMARRIAGE
        account - $4 per violation; (I) abusing or attempting to abuse ONLYMARRIAGE's flagging or
        reporting processes - $1 per violation; (J) distributing any software to facilitate violations of
        the USE Section - $1,000 per violation; (K) aggregating, displaying, framing, copying,

        the 24 hour period after the first 1,000 pages; (M) bypassing or attempting to bypass our
        moderation efforts - $4 per violation. You agree that these amounts are (1) a reasonable
        estimate of our damages (as actual damages are often difficult to calculate), (2) not a
        penalty, and (3) not otherwise limiting on our ability to recover under any legal theory or
        claim, including statutory damages and other equitable relief (e.g., for spam, we can elect
        between the above liquidated damages or statutory damages under the anti-spam
        statute). You further agree that repeated violations of the USE section will irreparably
        harm and entitle us to injunctive or equitable relief, in addition to monetary damages.
